Abstract for APSA 2020; submission deadline 14 January 2020.

Title (250ch max):

Sources of Misperception: Media Consumption and Economic Impact of Legal Immigration (84ch)

Abstract (1500ch max):

Various important issues at the center of today's politics are imbued with citizens' misperceptions. A growing body of research therefore explores whether such misperceptions can be mitigated by providing corrective information. While such corrections have been shown to be effective in reducing misperceptions, they appear to have little to no effect on underlying attitudes.

To improve upon approaches in the existing literature, we develop a pre-registered survey experiment. We utilize a randomized experimental process either assigning or allowing free-choice to different media sources. Respondents will be exposed to a news article about immigration reported by either Fox News or MSNBC. Along with this manipulation capturing the effect of delivery mode, our survey holds constant the news content regardless of news source to see the effect of the messenger. In assessing how respondents' attitudes change or do not change toward immigration policies, our experiment aims to examine how variations in the source and delivery mode of corrective information moderates their effectiveness.

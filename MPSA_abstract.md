Abstract for MPSA 2020; submission deadline in early October.

Title (250ch max):

Sources of Misperception: Media Consumption and Economic Impact of Legal Immigration (84ch)

Abstract (1500ch max):

Various important issues at the center of today's politics are imbued with citizens' misperceptions. A growing body of research therefore explores whether such misperceptions can be mitigated by providing corrective information. While these corrections have been shown to be effective in reducing misperceptions themselves, however, they appear to have little to no effects on underlying attitudes.

SY: Having smoother transaction from RQ to addressing our design would be better here. Any missing part in existing findings that makes ours differentiate from others?

To improve upon approaches in the existing literature, we develop a pre-registered survey experiment. Taking randomized experimental process between forced exposure and free-choice to the different media sources, respondent will be exposed a news article about immigration reported by either Fox News or MSNBC. Along with this manipulation capturing the effect of delivery mode, our survey holds constant news content regardless of news source to see the effect of messenger. In assessing respondents' attitudes changes or non-changes toward immigration policies, our experiment aims to examine how variations in the source and delivery mode of corrective information moderates their effectiveness.

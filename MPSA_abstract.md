Sources of Misperception: Media Consumption and Economic Impact of Legal Immigration (84ch) 

Abstract (1500ch max):

How does partisan media source affect perceptions of political information? There is a growing literature in political science on the role of social media in fostering misperceptions about important political issues. Focusing on immigration, recent studies (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2019) found that providing corrective information can mitigate misperceptions among citizens. However, a majority of this literature has focused on what people have said to change attitudes, but not who has said it.[!] To improve upon approaches in the existing literature, we develop a pre-registered survey experiment to explore not just the content of social media messaging, but also the effect of the messenger. We build off of the Preference Incorporating Choice and Assignment Design (De Benedictis-Kessner et al. 2019) which combines both a randomized experiment process as well as an endogenous information choice process. In our design treatment group, participants will be asked to choose, or be assigned to, a tweet and subsequent news article regarding the economic impact of legal immigration.  Unlike the PICA design, our survey holds constant the tweet and article content and only changes the source from which the news comes from, revealing a potentially stronger link to the messenger and not just the message. In a set of pre-registered hypotheses that together suggest that when participants select their preferred source, their attitudes toward immigration will change more than if assigned to a source.
